# Happy Health Website
This is the current project I've been working on for the previous 2 years. It provides the user with a health evaluation and healthy vitamins they should take. Most recently added a random forest multi-label
classification machine learning model to suggest healthy vitamins and how many they should take.

## Technology Used
React, Flask, Javascript, Python, PostgreSQL, JWTokens, Axios Interceptors, SkLearn

## How to run
- Clone repository
- Download Dependencies in the front end in the Client directory (npm install) and the backend in the root directory (pip install -r requirements.txt)
- Start the backend server (python app.py)
- Start the client (npm start)

## Example
- Home Screen
